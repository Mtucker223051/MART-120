        <h3>Short Story</h3>
        <br>
        <p>This is a story about my sister and her husband, and how they ended up with 2 beautiful miracle babies. 
        <p>My sister is 8 years older than I, and has always been a huge role model in my life. She was married in 2008, I was in 8th grade. 
        <p>My sister and her husband tried for kids, for many years but were told by many doctors, their chances weren't high. 
        <p>They never fully lost faith, but were close at times. In 2019, my brother in law's dad was diagnosed with cancer, that rapidly 
        <p>took over his body. Over the next year, before he passed, he prayed to God everyday that my sister and brother would have a child.
        <p>With everyone gathering and focusing on the health of her father in law, my sister had started to let go of the possibility of
        <p>having a baby. 
        <p>Come July 2020, my brother in law's dad passed. We had the memorial in October, and just a few days after that my 
        <p>sister found out she was pregnant. When they announced to the family, they were expecting, my sister found a onesie that read: 
        <p>"Hand picked for Earth, by my Grandpa in Heaven." The doctors monitored my sister's pregnancy because she was diagnosed with 
        <p>gestational diabetes as well. 
        <p>June 2021, my sister had her first baby girl, healthy and strong, and so beautiful. Everyone was so excited for the new addition. 
        <p>To our families surprise, my sister announced in Aug 2022, at my sister and brother in law's anniversary, they were expecting 
        <p>baby girl #2. 
        <p>March 2023, my sister had her second baby girl, just as precious as her first.
        <p>I knew I wanted to do something special and unique for my 2 baby nieces that they could keep for a long time. So I started 
        <p>drawing and working on an art piece for each of them.
        <p>I gifted the final pieces to my sister and brother in law on Christmas of 2023. I love how they turned out and I know they will
        <p>enjoy them as they grow. They are name plaques for either their bedroom doors or to hang up in their rooms.
