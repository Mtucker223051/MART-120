        <h3>My Favorite Hobbies:</h3>
        </span>
        <ul>
            <li>Sketching/Drawing</li>
            <span class="purpleColor"><p>I love to create designs or pictures inside of the lettering of someone's name. It's like typography, but instead of the image being made out of text; the images are inside each letter. I've done some family and friend's names.</p></span>
        <br>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <span class="purpleColor"><p>I've always enjoyed reading since I was little. I got away from it for a few years when my daughter was little. Once she started into school, I read books with her every night even more. She has now become a wonderful reader and loves books as much as I.</p></span>
